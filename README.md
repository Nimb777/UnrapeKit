First off, this is a work-in-progress code, and some stuff may be broken, leftover code, or simply non funcional or stupid.
Autohotkey v1, 1080p, no screen magnification, english language windows hotkeys.
The code uses an .ini file to store configurations and reloads after configurations. You may need to create that, or wait for the error.
First you press F9, then you set up your configuration hotkeys, like "CTRL & Del", "CTRL & Ins", "CTRL & PgUp", "CTRL & PgDn", "CTRL & Num".
For the delay part, just add what makes you feel comfortable, these timings do not need tro be exact. Around 40 will do for most cases.
For the capture part, the entries on the first gui were pretty much substituted for english entries, so they might not be necessary in some cases.
Open the menu, pint the mouse to the top right of the capture, press enter, move the mouse to the bottom-left, alt tab to the second gui and enter your spell name.
Suffixes are 1,2,3 etc for the menu lines from top to bottom, or -Timer1, -Timer2, -Timer3, etc for the buffs.
Then you go to scan config and enter that there, and every time you change equipment and the icons change around, you can simply rescan and they will update their coordinates.
The hotkey types are for buffing in 1. v1 doesnt work or i did not test it so it should not be working and it was broken before. The others scan from either the top right of the screen or the shortcut keys icons.
The first works better but you need multiple captures for that.
The other 3 just swap spells pretty much the same function.
5 and 6 are very much alike, it just adds a gui with radios and a background image to clicks and coordinates. May be bugged and needs referencing in 7 or the other way around.
7 is just open end automation. You can call and get inside a portal or swap all your equipment, flasks, buffs, etc very quickly for example.
Doing this against stabilishment old lady killers and corpse violators so they know.
